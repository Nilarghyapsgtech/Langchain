The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English- to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.

      "The Transformer is a model architecture that relies entirely on an attention mechanism to establish global dependencies between input and output, eschewing recurrence. It allows for significant parallelization and can achieve state-of-the-art translation quality after being trained for a relatively short time on powerful hardware. The Transformer is notable for being the first transduction model to use self-attention for computing representations of its input and output without relying on sequence-aligned RNNs or convolutional layers. Its architecture consists of stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers for both the encoder and decoder. Additionally, it employs multi-head attention in various ways.\n"
